# UC Davis CAES Next.js Starter

This is a starter template for building web applications using Next.js, created by CA&ES.

## Features

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Dev Container**: Docker-based development environment for consistent setups.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system.
- **Prisma**: Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript.
- **AuthJS (Next-Auth)**: Authentication solution for Next.js applications.
- **ESLint**: Tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter for maintaining consistent code style.
- **tRPC**: End-to-end typesafe APIs for Next.js applications.

## Working Notes

- DATABASE_URL will be autogenerated based on your folder name and loaded into the dev env. Can overwrite but only if you don't want to use local
- Still need to setup devcontainer plugins
- People should run `npx auth secret` to generate a secret for auth.js for new projects

Below is the standard Next.js README content, which is included in the project.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
